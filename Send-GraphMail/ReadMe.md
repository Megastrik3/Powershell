## EXAMPLE

Send Graph email message to multiple users with attachments and multiple To, CC and single Bcc

```Send-GraphMail -To @('user1@domain.com','user2@domain.com') -CC @('cc@domain.com','cc1@domain.com') -Bcc "bcc@domain.com" -Subject "Test Message" -MessageFormat HTML -Body 'This is the Message Body' -DeliveryReport -ReadReport -Flag -Importance High -Attachments C:\MyFile.txt -DocumentType 'text/plain'```

Send Graph email, load the Body from a file stored locally, make sure to use the BodyFromFile switch

````Send-GraphMail -To 'vdi1@adcci.gov.ae' -Subject "Test Message" -MessageFormat HTML -Body C:\11111.csv -BodyFromFile -DeliveryReport -ReadReport -Flag -Importance High -Attachments 'C:\MyFile.txt' -DocumentType 'text/plain'````

Return and get how the JSON is structured without sending the Email, this is done by using the -ReturnJSON Parameter

````$JSONFile=send-GraphMail -To 'vdi1@adcci.gov.ae' -Subject "Test Message" -MessageFormat HTML -Body "Hi This is New Message" -Flag -ReturnJSON````
