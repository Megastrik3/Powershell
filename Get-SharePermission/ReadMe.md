**Get all Share Folders and perform Permission test Read/Write/Delete on them to see what limited user can do**

One of the biggest challenges for sysadmins and the security team is the open share, were domain users have full Read/Write/Delete Access to a folder in the server. I am not talking about the Home Folder or Roaming Profile, I am talking about folders that are created for temporary use and got forgotten or a misconfigured ACL for a folder in an application.

The question is, How to confirm if domain users can Access/Read/Write/Delete files in a shared folder without manually reviewing the ACL for both share and NTFS in all the servers ?!
